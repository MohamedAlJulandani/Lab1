                    <p>
                        A German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two
                        pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics, his work is also known for its influence
                        on the philosophy of science.

                        Niels Bohr

                    <p>
                        A Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and
                        quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr was also a
                        philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.

                    <p>
                        A German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published
                        his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and
                        Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation
                        of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated.

                        system and how it changes dynamically in time.
